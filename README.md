# DOM

there are a lot of dom elements ... i tried virtualising with [react-virtual](https://github.com/TanStack/virtual/blob/main/examples/react/variable/src/main.tsx), but it seemed to just render them all at once too...
and actually we only render the page once, so as long as renders are in control ... it should be fine ....
